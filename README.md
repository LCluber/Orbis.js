## Synopsis

  Orbis.js is an asynchronous assets loader written in Javascript.
  - Setup your json config file containing all your assets (images, textures, sprites, sounds, musics, texts, jsons),
  - launch the loader and use onProgress callback to set your own progress bar design,
  - wait for onComplete callback to start using your freshly loaded assets.

## Code Example

 [See a basic example on the dedicated website](http://orbisjs.lcluber.com/#example).

## Motivation

The main purpose of this library is to provide a simple way to load assets only when needed instead of loading everything when the main page loads.
